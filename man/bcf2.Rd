\arguments{
\item{y}{Response variable}

\item{z}{Treatment variable}

\item{x_control}{Design matrix for the prognostic function mu(x)}

\item{x_moderate}{Design matrix for the covariate-dependent treatment effects tau(x)}

\item{pihat}{Length n estimates of propensity score}

\item{nburn}{Number of burn-in MCMC iterations}

\item{nsim}{Number of MCMC iterations to save after burn-in. The chain will run for nsim*nthin iterations after burn-in}

\item{nthin}{Save every nthin'th MCMC iterate. The total number of MCMC iterations will be nsim*nthin + nburn.}

\item{update_interval}{Print status every update_interval MCMC iterations}

\item{ntree_control}{Number of trees in mu(x)}

\item{sd_control}{SD(mu(x)) marginally at any covariate value (or its prior median if use_muscale=TRUE)}

\item{base_control}{Base for tree prior on mu(x) trees (see details)}

\item{power_control}{Power for the tree prior on mu(x) trees}

\item{ntree_moderate}{Number of trees in tau(x)}

\item{sd_moderate}{SD(tau(x)) marginally at any covariate value (or its prior median if use_tauscale=TRUE)}

\item{base_moderate}{Base for tree prior on tau(x) trees (see details)}

\item{power_moderate}{Power for the tree prior on tau(x) trees (see details)}

\item{nu}{Degrees of freedom in the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{lambda}{Scale parameter in the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{sigq}{Calibration quantile for the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{sighat}{Calibration estimate for the chisq prior on \eqn{sigma^2}}

\item{include_pi}{Takes values "control", "moderate", "both" or "none". Whether to
include pihat in mu(x) ("control"), tau(x) ("moderate"), both or none. Values of "control"
or "both" are HIGHLY recommended with observational data.}

\item{use_muscale}{Use a half-Cauchy hyperprior on the scale of mu.}

\item{use_tauscale}{Use a half-Normal prior on the scale of tau.}

\description{
A slightly upgraded version of \code{bcf::bcf}. The output list is given class \code{bcf}
and the treatment effects are returned as an element of the list.
