\usage{
tidy_att(model, treatment, common_support_method, cutoff, ...)

\arguments{
\item{model}{A supported Bayesian model fit that can provide fits and predictions.}

\item{treatment}{A character string specifying the name of the treatment variable.}

\item{common_support_method}{Either "sd", or "chisq". Default is unspecified, and no common support calculation is done.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{tidybayes::epred_draws} typically scale for \code{BART} models.}

\value{
A tidy data frame (tibble) with treatment effect values.
}
\description{

Assumes treated column is either a integer column of 1's (treated) and 0's (nontreated) or logical indicating treatment if TRUE.
