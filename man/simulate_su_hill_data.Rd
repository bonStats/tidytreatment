\description{
Sample \eqn{n} observations with the following scheme:
\enumerate{
  \item Covariates: \eqn{X_j ~ N(0,1)}.
  \item Assignment: \eqn{Z ~ Bin(n, p)}  with \eqn{p = logit^{-1}(\omega + X \gamma^L + Q \gamma^N)}.
  \item Mean response: \eqn{E(Y(0)|X) = X \beta_0^L + Q \beta_0^N } and \eqn{E(Y(1)|X) = X \beta_1^L + Q \beta_1^N}.
  \item Observation: \eqn{Y ~ N(\mu,\sigma_y^2))}.
}
}
\details{
Coefficients used are returned in the list this function creates. See Table 1 in Su and Hill (2013) for the table of coefficients.
The \eqn{X_j} are in a data.frame named \code{data} in the returned list.
The formula for the model matrix \eqn{[X,Q]} is named \code{su_hill_formula} in the returned list.
The coefficients used for the model matrix are contained in \code{coefs}.
