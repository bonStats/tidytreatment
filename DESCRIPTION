Description: Functions for extracting tidy data from Bayesian treatment effect models, in particular BART, but extensions are possible. Functionality includes extracting tidy posterior summaries as in 'tidybayes' <https://github.com/mjskay/tidybayes>, estimating (average) treatment effects, common support calculations, and plotting useful summaries of these.
